This Flask app is built kind of weird. For new apps you can just create new directories with your apps inside them and as long as they have a `blueprint.py`, the blueprint will get automatically added to the Flask app.

### Development quickstart
1. `python3 -m venv .virtualenv`
2. activate the virtual environment
3. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `export FLASK_APP=init.py`
5. `flask run`

### Development quickstart for react apps inside apps directory
1. Navigate to desired app directory (e.g. `apps/landing`)
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
